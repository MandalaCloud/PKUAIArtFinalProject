# Paris Olympics 2024:Olympics Together!
As our AIArt(in Chinese 《视觉艺术与计算美学》) course final project ,we use a website to display our AI-generated posters about different animals playing different sports.

## Technology Stack
- `react` , a frontend UI framework.
- `next.js` , can use react components to create web applications.

We use this [template](https://github.com/tbakerx/react-resume-template) and modify a lot of codes and files to make our own website. My sincerest thanks to [Tim Baker](https://github.com/tbakerx)!

## Dependencies
- `giscus` , a open-source component to enable users to make discussions through github discussion. Our discussion repo [here](https://github.com/PaperCrane-ovo/AIArtDiscussion). Why didn't we use this repo ? It was my fault, but it seemed harmless.

## Website Address
[https://olympics.papercrane.cc](https://olympics.papercrane.cc)

Welcome to our website and enjoy our work. But the free quota of vercel is only 100G per month, so please wait for us to launch smaller works!
